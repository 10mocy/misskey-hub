For details, please check <a href="./apps">here</a>.</p><p>However, functionality of third-party applications will inevitably lag behind the official Web client, so unless you really want to use a native application, we recommend the official Web client instead. As the Misskey Web client supports PWA, it is also possible to make it act as if it was a native application instead. For details regarding this, please check <a href="todo">here</a>.</p><h2 id="can-t-i-log-in-through-a-mastodon-client" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#can-t-i-log-in-through-a-mastodon-client" aria-hidden="true">#</a> &quot;Can&#39;t I log in through a Mastodon client?&quot;</h2><p>As Misskey is not compatible with the Mastodon API, barring some exceptions, using Mastodon clients to log into Misskey is not possible.</p><h2 id="what-do-i-do-when-i-want-to-follow-users-from-other-servers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-do-i-do-when-i-want-to-follow-users-from-other-servers" aria-hidden="true">#</a> &quot;What do I do when I want to follow users from other servers?&quot;</h2><p>Select the search bar from the menu and enter their username including their host server.
